# Elements of AI: Building AI - Advanced
[Elements of AI: Building AI - Advanced](https://buildingai.elementsofai.com/) is an online course by Reaktor and University of Helsinki worth 2 ECTS.

It aims to introduce students to how to build AI in Python, that is: how to implement probability algorithms, machine learning and neural networks in Python.

This repository contains my personal answers to the exercises in the course.
## [Chapter 1 - Getting started with AI](chapter-1/)

## [Chapter 2 - Dealing with uncertainty](chapter-2/)

## [Chapter 3 - Machine learning](chapter-3/)

## [Chapter 4 - Neural networks](chapter-4/)
